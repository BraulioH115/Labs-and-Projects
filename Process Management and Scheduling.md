Part 1: Process Management

Background Process Execution

--We executed a program in the background using the `&` operator:

    ./lab03 &

This confirmed that the process was running independently of the shell.

To verify the process was running:

    ps aux | grep lab03



*Parent-Child Relationship*:

--We killed the parent process while the child was still running. The child became an orphan process, adopted by the init process. This was verified by seeing a Parent PID (PPID) of 1 for the child process in ps output.

*Zombie Process Behavior*:


--We killed the child process and kept the parent running. 
The result:

-The child process entered a zombie state.

-The parent remained active.

Command used:

    ps -u $USER
